<h3>A small list of my favourite movies of all time</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Interstellar</h2>
<p>A fantastic movie by Christopher Nolan, that contains plenty of twists and turns, and really bends your mind in a new way.</p>
<h2>The Interview</h2>
<p>A absolutely hilarious movie, about two guys that get the opportunity to interview Kim Jong-Un. Very controversial, but also very funny.</p>
<h2>Inception</h2>
<p>Another nolan movie, another mind bender. This one literally takes you into the mind of other people, and is a very interesting movie.</p>
